Advanced Multithreaded RTSP Bruteforce &amp; Path Discovery Tool BY ABDULRAHEEM BUTT
A simple, multi‑threaded Python tool that bruteforces RTSP credentials and RTSP stream paths on IP cameras, DVR/NVRs, and IoT video devices.

This tool attempts to authenticate using a list of username:password pairs, and checks multiple RTSP paths (both built‑in common camera paths and user‑supplied paths from path.txt).
If valid credentials and a valid RTSP stream path are found, the tool immediately prints the result and stops.
